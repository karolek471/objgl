The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Commercial use is only permited if the provided code is only a part of the software responsible for loading the Wavefront OBJ Format.
For commercial use my software must be less than 36.666% of the total code responsible for file format loading 
(counted in lines, excluding comments, multiline array initializers and preprocessor statements, 
given the line layout in my software was not altered).

To put it simply:
- You may modify and redistribute this code (non-commercialy)
- You must not claim you're the author of this software
- You may sell your product if the software provided by me, karolek471, is a minor part of the program so: game engines, games, 3D modelling software
- You must not use my code commercialy if the software provided by me, karolek471, is a major part of the program so: OBJ viewer, OBJ loader

To put it even simpler:
If your program is only capable of loading the .obj files using my software, and that's it, you can't use it commercialy
If your program is capable of loading all kinds of formats, including .obj using my software - it's okay, you can use it commercialy.
